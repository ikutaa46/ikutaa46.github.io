<p align="center"><?php echo $sitetitle; ?> is a free link protection program to avoid any 
links from being indexed by spiders and eventually being listed on search 
engines. Recently, it has been a known fact that some File Hosters have been using 
private spiders (bots) to track certain file names and delete them immediately 
without verification, even if the file never contained illegal contents just to 
avoid any law suits against them. Many users have reported to have special permission to upload and share some 
files, where the file hoster's spider would go and delete it anyway.
<p>Also, users reported their links being indexed 
by Google and other various search engines, some of the reasons being incorrect 
option settings or simply the spider didn't obey their options set by the uploader. <?php echo $sitetitle; ?>'s main goal is to hide these links from these 
automated bots where you are free to name the link's title to whatever suits 
you.</p>
